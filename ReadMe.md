# Setup instructions

Open project in terminal and run: ```docker-compose up```


Then run: ```python setup.py```


If everything worked correctly you should have a running neo4j instance with default ports and a second module next to 
the main project module.

Neo4j can be looked at in browser: ```http://localhost:7474/browser/```
